# Android Programming: The Big Nerd Ranch Guide - Errata


## Chapter 1

### Page 26 
In the 2nd to last line the URL for the developer site link has an extra "http://" at the front. 

## Chapter 2

### Page 37

Button specification in the XML diagram shows `android:text="@string/next_question_button"`, but it should read `android:text="@string/next_button"`.

### Page 39 - Listing 2.6

Missing comma when creating the array:

    private TrueFalse[] mQuestionBank = new TrueFalse[] {
        new TrueFalse(R.string.question_oceans, true),
        new TrueFalse(R.string.question_mideast, false),
        new TrueFalse(R.string.question_africa, false) <-- comma needed at end of this line
        new TrueFalse(R.string.question_americas, true),
        new TrueFalse(R.string.question_asia, true),
    };
    
The extra trailing comma is not required, but we typically include it because it makes adding new items later easier.

### Page 51

Same error as Page 37, though text is striked out in the code example here.


### Page 45

Paragragh at bottom of the page says, 

    Within this directory, locate the drawable-hdpi, res/drawable-mdpi, and drawable-xhdpi directories.

The middle item should omit "res/".

### Misc: mQuestionBank vs. mAnswerKey

The instance variable for the list of questions is called mQuestionBank in this chapter. In Chapters 3, 4, and 5, the same variable is called mAnswerKey.

Go with the name you originally typed in - mQuestionBank. Chapters 3, 4, and 5 are incorrect.


## Chapter 5

### Page 93

A passage says, 

     "You can just create a new file named fragment_crime.xml..." 

The "fragment_crime.xml" filename should be "activity_cheat.xml" instead.

### Page 94 - Listing 5.2

The `android:text` attribute for the first TextView is shown as "@string/warning_text_view". This should instead be `"@string/warning_text"`.

## Chapter 8

### Page 151 - Listing 8.3

The EditText includes two new margin attributes that were not previously present. These two attributes should be marked bold in the text.

### Page 152 - Listing 8.5

A passage says,

    Organize your imports to resolve the references to DatePicker and CheckBox.

There is no DatePicker in the listing, so the passage should not mention DatePicker at all.

## Chapter 18 - Context Menus and Contextual Action Mode

### Page 283 - Figure 18.1

The menu text should read "Delete" instead of "Delete Crime".

### Page 286 - Figure 18.2

The menu text should read "Delete" instead of "Delete Crime".

### Page 290 - Listing 18.7
The listing as a whole looks like this:
     
        ...
        listView.setChoiceMode(ListView.CHOICE_MODE_MULTIPLE_MODAL);
        listView.setMultiChoiceModeListener(new MultiChoiceModeListener() {
        ...[lots of code here]...
        });
            
        return v;
     }


It should be inside an else statement, though. So the listing should actually look like this:

            ...
        } else {
            listView.setChoiceMode(ListView.CHOICE_MODE_MULTIPLE_MODAL);
            listView.setMultiChoiceModeListener(new MultiChoiceModeListener() {
                ...[lots of code here]...
            });
        }

        return v;
    }


### Page 297

The ActionBarSherlock challenge omits one key step - you must change the theme for your app to one of the ABS themes (Theme.Sherlock, Theme.Sherlock.Light, or Theme.Sherlock.Light.DarkActionBar), or to a custom theme that inherits from one of those themes. Without this step, your app will not run on older devices. 


## Chapter 21

### Page 348 - Listing 21.2 

The indentation on the following line in the toJSON() method is incorrect: `json.put(JSON_SUSPECT, mSuspect);`.
The method should instead read:

    public JSONObject toJSON() throws JSONException {
        JSONObject json = new JSONObject();
        â€¦
        if (mPhoto != null)
        	json.put(JSON_PHOTO, mPhoto.toJSON());
        json.put(JSON_SUSPECT, mSuspect);
        return json;
    }
    
The bracing is correct around this line; the indentation, however, is not. This line should be indented one indentation level to the left, to be even with "return json;" on the following line.
