Chapter 6, Fragments And The Fragment Manager

    Pg 80, Figure 6.11: On TableLayout: layout_height="wrap_content"
    Pg 81, "The first thing to consider when preparing a fragment to
        host an activity..." should be "The first thing to consider when 
        preparing an activity to host a fragment..."
    Pg 81, Figure 6.13: crime_fragment should be fragment_crime

Chapter 9, ListView
    Pg 147, Figure 9.29: focusable has already been set to "true" on the previous page.
    Pg 147, Figure 9.29: CheckBox also needs android:clickable="false"

Chapter 10, Multiple Activities
    Pg 156, Figure 10.13: Crime is a reference, so this code is not necessary
    Pg 162, Figure 10.25: LinearLayout should not be deleted here

Chapter 11, Menus
    Pg 165, Instructions on this page omit the xhdpi folder.
    Pg 166, Figure 11.4: This listing includes two mysterious strings which are never used. They should be ignored.
    Pg 176, "Now you can run..." You cannot at this point use the home button to navigate up,
        because it has not been enabled. Call "setDisplayHomeAsUpEnabled(true)" as depicted
        on page 178 to enable the Home button.

Chapter 12, Camera
    Pg 199, Figure 13.15: The Camera.open(int) method is only available on SDK 9 and up. To prevent
        Android Lint from producing an error from this code, change your project's minSdkVersion
        to "9" in your AndroidManifest.xml.
    Pg 210, Figure 13.29: The code here disagrees with the text on page 209. The code is right; the text 
        is wrong.
    Pg 210, Figure 13.29: onPause is missing code from earlier in the book. Preserve the existing code
        in your project here.
